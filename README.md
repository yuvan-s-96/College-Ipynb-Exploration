# College Jupyter Notebook Collection

## Overview
This repository contains various Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files related to different college subjects and projects. These notebooks include code implementations, explanations, and analyses for various topics studied in college.

## Contents
The repository consists of multiple Jupyter notebooks categorized into different subjects:

### 1. **Mathematics & Statistics**
   - Numerical methods, linear algebra, probability, and statistics.
   - Data visualization techniques for statistical analysis.

### 2. **Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence**
   - Supervised and unsupervised learning implementations.
   - Deep learning models using TensorFlow/PyTorch.
   - Feature engineering and model evaluation techniques.

### 3. **Computer Vision & Image Processing**
   - OpenCV-based image manipulation and processing.
   - Object detection and recognition using deep learning.
   
### 4. **Data Science & Big Data**
   - Data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature selection.
   - Working with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

### 5. **Algorithms & Competitive Programming**
   - Implementation of sorting, searching, and graph algorithms.
   - Dynamic programming and problem-solving approaches.

### 6. **Web Development & APIs**
   - Flask/Django projects with API development.
   - Integrating web applications with machine learning models.

## Setup & Usage
To run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

```sh
pip install jupyter notebook
```

### Running the Notebooks
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_link>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and run the `.ipynb` files as needed.

## Future Improvements
